Components worked on by Tim:

1. Sqlite (sqlite.py, ppp_cmd.py)
    Robustness:
        The sqlite functionality was reasonably robust, it could handle not having a sqlite file etc.
    Implementation:
        The implementation in ppp_cmd.py was okay, it was implemented in testing functions but not as
        proper functionality of the program. Would have liked to have an option for other commands when
        generating diagrams etc. to have an option to save to database

2. MySql (mysql.py, ppp_cmd.py)
    Robustness:

    Implementation:
